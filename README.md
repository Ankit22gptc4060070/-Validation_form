Project Name: JavaScript Form Validation

Description:
The JavaScript Form Validation project is a web application designed to ensure that user input in a web form meets certain criteria before it is submitted. This project leverages HTML for the form structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing validation logic. The goal is to provide users with immediate feedback on their input, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

Features:
Real-time Validation:

Validates user input as they type, providing instant feedback.
Highlights errors and displays appropriate messages when input does not meet the specified criteria.
Field-Specific Checks:

Required Fields: Ensures that all mandatory fields are filled out.
Email Validation: Checks if the email address is in a valid format.
Password Strength: Validates the strength of the password based on length, special characters, numbers, and upper/lower case letters.
Confirm Password: Ensures that the password and confirm password fields match.
Phone Number: Validates the format of the phone number (e.g., only digits, or specific patterns).
Custom Validation: Additional custom validation rules can be added as needed.
User-Friendly Interface:

Form fields are clearly labeled, with placeholders for guidance.
Error messages are displayed in a user-friendly manner, helping users correct their input.
Success messages are shown when the input is valid.
Submit Control:

The form cannot be submitted until all fields are valid.
If validation fails, the form highlights the fields with errors and prevents submission.
Technology Stack:
HTML: Structures the form and its fields.
CSS: Provides styling for the form, error messages, and success states.
Bootstrap (optional): Can be used to enhance form layout and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Implements the validation logic, controls form submission, and manages real-time feedback.
Project Structure:
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the form elements and references to CSS and JavaScript files.
style.css: A CSS file that styles the form, including input fields, error messages, and success indicators.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the validation logic for each form field.
